Next time:

1) Move command - Deleting vertices?
		TODO: 	This is fine except the repainting part 
				deleting vertices causes repaint to go wild
				Moving entire polygons? Should we?
				Highlighting polygons
2) Labelling
3) Finish FileIO:
				decide on file format
				write/read sessions
				exception handling (e.g. specify file types)
4) Undo/redo
5) Deal with ending a shape with only one vertex
